Data availability. The RealityMining dataset is publicly available https://github.com/j2kun/reality-mining and other public repositories. Note we adapt the code from this repo for processing the dataset and include the modified script here as well for reference (a_parse_bluetooth_nw_adapted_j2kun.py). We also include the script for creating dataset by month.

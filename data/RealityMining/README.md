Data availability. The RealityMining dataset is publicly available after completing the form http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining.html. We then rely on the repository for processing the dataset https://github.com/j2kun/reality-mining. Note we adapt the code from this repo for processing the dataset and include the modified script here as well for reference (a_parse_bluetooth_nw_adapted_j2kun.py). We also include the script for creating dataset by month (0_generate_RM_by_month.py).

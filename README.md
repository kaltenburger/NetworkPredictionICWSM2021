## Node Attribute Prediction
Replication code for ICWSM'21 Paper ``What is the Node Attribute Prediction Task? Within-Network, Across-Network, versus Across-Layer Tasks''.

### Documentation
This repository contains all the corresponding code to recreate tables and figures.

### Directions
1. Save data in corresponding data folders. 

2. How to run code where folder organization is briefly described below: 
  * ./data/: Placeholder folder for storing raw datasets. We use the Facebook100 (FB100) dataset (Traud et al. 2011; Traud, Mucha, and Porter 2012), the Copenhagen Networks Study (Stopczynski et al. 2014) and the Reality Mining dataset (Eagle and Pentland 2006).
  * ./code/: Code for recreating tables and figures in main paper. Note that relative file directories will have to be updated in the code as needed.
  * ./figs/: Folder for all figures.
  * ./output/: Output files generated from some of the scripts in the ./code/ folder.

3. For all the ReFeX code, we adapt from https://github.com/LLNL/refex-rolx.
